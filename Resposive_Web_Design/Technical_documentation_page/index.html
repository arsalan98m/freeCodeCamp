          <p>Getting started with Linux is easy once you become familiar with the
      system’s features. In this guide, I am going to break everything down for you
      in a simple approach that will enable you to grasp everything quickly. I also
      don’t assume you know something already, and will go into detail for every
      concept that I teach.</p>

          <header>Operating System</header>
          <p>A computer, complete with all its parts – the CPU, mouse, monitor, and
      keyboard – will not work without a central program that will piece it all
      together. In order to use a PC, you need a piece of software inside which will
      take care of making the hardware work for you. A special kind of software
      which is between the hardware of the PC, and the programs that you want to
      use and work with. This piece of software is the Operating System, or more
            easily referred to as just an OS.</p>
      <p>In short, an operating system is the software that brings together a
      computer’s hardware and the different programs that you want to install on it.
      Without it, when you booted up your PC, you would not get anything on the
      monitor, and neither mouse nor keyboard will work. You would be unable to
      watch videos, listen to music, edit photos, or to simply write a note.</p>
          
          <p>With that said, an operating system is responsible for doing the
      following tasks:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>Detect hardware</b> – An OS is responsible for validating the
      components of a computer during boot up (hard drive, CPU,
      network cards, mouse, etc.) and loading the corresponding drivers
      and modules for the hardware to properly run.</li>
            <li><b>Manage memory</b> – Each application needs a specific amount of
      RAM and swap memory to function. The OS is responsible for
      assigning memory allocations, and for handling memory requests.</li>
            
            <li><b>Start-up services</b> – The OS manages several processes running in
      the background known as daemon processes.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_Linux">
          <header>What is Linux</header>
          <p>Linux is an operating system, similar to the examples mentioned in the
      previous section, and is often described as Unix-like.</p>
          
          <p>The stark difference between Linux and other operating systems lies in
      the fact that Linux is an open-source operating system. This means that Linux
      is continuously developed collaboratively. Unlike Windows and OS X which
      are both tied to the respective companies (Windows and Apple), not one
      company owns Linux’ development and support. Builder Linux is a shared
      vision, with different companies sharing research, development, and the
      associated costs. This open source cooperation among companies and
      developers has led to making Linux one of the best ecosystems for use from
      small digital wristwatches to servers and supercomputers. Based on statistics,
      there are at least 100 companies and more than 1000 developers who work
      together for every kernel release.</p>
          
          <p>In addition to the tasks performed by an operating system, Linux has the
      following characteristics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Supports clustering</b> – Multiple Linux systems can be configured
      to appear as one system from the outside. Service can be configured
      among clusters and still offer a seamless user experience.</li>
            
            <li><b>Runs virtualization</b> – Virtualization allows one computer to
      appear as several computers to users. Linux can be configured as a
      virtualization host – where you could run other OS such as
      Windows, Mac OS, or other Linux systems. All the virtualized
      systems appear as separate systems to the outside world.</li>
            
            <li><b>Cloud Computing </b>– Linux can handle complex, large-scale
      virtualization needs – including virtual networks, networked
      storage, and virtual guests.</li>
            
            <li><b>Options for Storage</b> – Data need not always be stored in your
      computer’s hard disk. Linux offers different local and networked
      storage options such as Fiber Channel and iSCSI.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In this chapter, I will provide some brief information on this operating
      system’s architecture, and also discuss the different flavours of Linux that a
      beginner can choose from.</p>
          <h3>Linux Architecture</h3>
          <p>Linux architecture can be divided into two spaces. The User Space and
      the Kernel Space.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>User Space –</li>
            <li>Kernel Space –</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="History_of_Linux">
          <header>History of Linux</header>
          <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds, a student from Finland, created Linux in 1991
      using C and assembly language. Linux was developed as a free, open source,
      open license operating system, which enables developers around the world to
      study and modify the OS. Since the release of the initial source code in 1991,
      it has grown now to more than 18 million lines of code under GNU General
      Public License</p>
          
          <p>Initially, Torvalds named the operating system he invented as Freax, a
      combination of the words “free”, “freak”, and “x”. He uploaded his files to an
      FTP server where his colleague, Ari Lemmke, was the FTP server
      administrator. Lemmke thought Freax was not a good sounding name so he
      renamed the folder to Linux without telling Torvalds. Later on, Torvalds
      approved the name change.</p>
          
          <p>In 1992, Linux was licensed under GNU GPL and the first Linux
      distributions (also called distro) were created – Boot-root, MCC Interim
      Linux, Softlanding Linux System (SLS), and Yggdrasil Linux where one of
      the first few released in the same year. Several distributions have been
      created over time: Slackware - the oldest existing distro, Debian - the largest
      community distribution, and commercial distributions Red Hat and SUSE.</p>
          
          <p>In recent years, Linux has seen more developments. The server market
      revenue of Linux has already exceeded that of Unix. The Linux-based mobile
      OS Android has gained 75% of the market share. In 2015, Linux Kernel
      Version 4.0 was released.</p>
          
          <h2>Linux as Compared to other Operating Systems</h2>
          
          <p>Now, let’s get to the important question: Is Linux better than the others?
      Let’s compare Linux with other well-known operating systems.</p>
          
          <h3>Cost</h3>
          <p>If you obtained Windows legally, you would have paid more than
      $100 or even more for the Pro version. Linux, on the other hand, is
      free of charge. For Linux commercial distributions, companies sell
      services such as support and documentation, but the OS itself
      comes for free.</p>
          
          <h3>Viruses</h3>
          <p>Linux hardly gets any viruses. Since most PCs run on Windows,
      attackers target Windows OS. The open-source policy of Linux is
      key. With many developers working on Linux, there are more eyes
      focused on seeing security flaws. There’s plenty of help too, if ever
      a real Linux virus comes around. Proprietary operating systems are
      tied with the number of employed engineers and resources they
      have. With Linux, any developer from around the world can simply
      download the source code and help out with finding and solving
      flaws.</p>
          
          <h3>Support</h3>
          <p>Linux has a large community online where new users can get
      information, read FAQs, and ask questions if there are programs or
      features that you think are not working right. The great thing about
      open-source is that with plenty of people involved in the OS, there
      are an unlimited number of resources that you can use and learn
      from. All these come for free too!</p>

          <h3>Essential Linux Commands</h3>
          <p>As a new Linux enthusiast, you can perform many of the tasks using the
      GUI. However, if you fancy learning more commands that you can use in the
      shell prompt, here’s a cheat sheet of the most important Linux commands.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>Info: </b>Shows online information about a command </li>
            <li><b>Man:</b>Shows details of a command</li>
            <li><b>whatis:</b>Shows a short description of a specific keyword</li>
            <li><b>Type:</b>Shows the location of a command file</li>
            
            <li><b>Alias:</b>Assign a command alias – especially useful for long
      commands</li>
            
            <li><b>unalias:</b>Remove command alias</li>
            <li><b>Cd:</b>Change directory</li>
            <li><b>Pwd: </b>Displays the current directory</li>
            <li><b>Cat:</b>Show a text file in one output</li>
            <li><b>Cal:</b>Show the calendar for the specified month or year</li>
          </ul>
